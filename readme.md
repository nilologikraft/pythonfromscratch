## Book Overview

This book is designed specifically with programming beginners in mind. Basic programming concepts — such as expressions, variables, loops, decisions, lists, dictionaries, sets, functions, files, classes, objects, SQLite 3 databases, regular expressions and graphical interfaces with Tkinter — are clearly presented one by one with examples and exercises to illustrate. The book aims to explore computer programming as an everyday tool. It can be read during an introduction to computer programming course or used as a study guide for self-learners. Only basic computer knowledge, such as typing texts, opening and saving files, is needed to start the course. All software used in the book can be downloaded for free and runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Although Python (version +3.13) is a very powerful language full of modern programming features, this book focuses primarily on programming logic and teaching how to program. Some language features were not used in order to favor programming logic exercises and offer the reader broader preparation for other languages. Powerful language features such as generators, sets, lambda functions and comprehensions are presented, and the reader will find various notes and explanations of Python-specific features in addition to programming logic.

## Who this book is written for

Students who want to learn programming on their own, the book was written so you can gradually learn to program. The first chapters explain the basic programming concepts in a logical order, with practical exercises. All you need to know is how to use a computer and a browser (Firefox, Edge, Safari, or Google Chrome). The book starts by showing how to download and install Python on Windows, but it also covers Linux (Ubuntu) and macOS. Special attention was given to conditional structures (if), loops (while), and functions (including recursion). The book also covers string manipulation (text processing), so you learn to work with variables containing text and prepare to write more complete programs. At the end, we cover files, creating simple web pages, a light introduction to object-oriented programming, regular expressions, and graphical interfaces.
