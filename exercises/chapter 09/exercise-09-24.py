# In case of a read error, the program stops executing.
# If the error occurs during saving, the unsaved data
# will be lost.
# These problems can be solved by modifying the
# read and save functions, adding try/except blocks.
# Ideally, the program should display the error message and continue running.
# In the case of saving, the data should not be lost and the user should be able
# to try again.
